So in short, to draw the first triangle we need to:

    Create a VkInstance
    Select a supported graphics card (VkPhysicalDevice)
    Create a VkDevice and VkQueue for drawing and presentation
    Create a window, window surface and swap chain
    Wrap the swap chain images into VkImageView
    Create a render pass that specifies the render targets and usage
    Create framebuffers for the render pass
    Set up the graphics pipeline
    Allocate and record a command buffer with the draw commands for every possible swap chain image
    Draw frames by acquiring images, submitting the right draw command buffer and returning the images back to the swap chain

It's a lot of steps, but the purpose of each individual step will be made very simple and clear in the upcoming chapters. If you're confused about the relation of a single step compared to the whole program, you should refer back to this chapter.
